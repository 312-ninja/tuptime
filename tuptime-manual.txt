============
| Abstract |
============

Tuptime report historical and statistical running time of the system, keeping it between restarts.
Indeed, it can:
  - count system startups
  - register first boot time (a.k.a. installation time)
  - count nicely and accidentally shutdowns 
  - uptime and downtime percentage since first boot time
  - accumulated system uptime, downtime and total
  - largest, shortest and average uptime and downtime
  - current uptime
  - print formatted table or list with most of the previous values


=================
| Prerequisites |
=================

Operating system:
   - Linux
   - FreeBSD

Software:
   - Python 2.7 or Python 3.X (Latest recomended)
   - Python modules (most included in python core by default):
       sys, os, optparse, sqlite3, datetime, locale, platform, subprocess,
       operator, time


================
| Installation |
================

Clone repository and copy executable file:

	# cp tuptime/latest/tuptime /usr/bin/tuptime

Copy cron file:

	# cp tuptime/latest/cron.d/tuptime /etc/cron.d/tuptime

If is a system with systemd, copy service file and enable it:
	
	# cp tuptime/latest/systemd/tuptime.service /lib/systemd/system/
        # systemctl enable tuptime.service

If the linux system don't have systemd, copy init file:

	# cp tuptime/latest/init.d/tuptime.init.d-debian7 /etc/init.d/tuptime
	# update-rc.d tuptime defaults

# If is a FreeBSD, copy rc file:

        # cp tuptime/latest/rc.d/tuptime-freebsd /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tuptime
        # chmod 555 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tuptime
	# echo 'tuptime_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

Finally, run it:

	# tuptime

-h, --help
  Print a quick reference of the command line parameters.

  Examples:
         tuptime -h
         tuptime --help


-d <DATE_FORMAT>, --date=<DATE_FORMAT>
  Change the format of the date. By it's printed based on locales.
  Allow values are:

	%a	Weekday as locale’s abbreviated name.
	%A	Weekday as locale’s full name.
	%w	Weekday as a decimal number, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is 
		Saturday.
	%d	Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%b	Month as locale’s abbreviated name.
	%B	Month as locale’s full name.
	%m	Month as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%y	Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%Y	Year with century as a decimal number.
	%H	Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%I	Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%p	Locale’s equivalent of either AM or PM.
	%M	Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%S	Second as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%f	Microsecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left.
	%z	UTC offset in the form +HHMM or -HHMM (empty string if the 
		the object is naive).
	%Z	Time zone name (empty string if the object is naive).
	%j	Day of the year as a zero-padded decimal number.
	%U	Week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) 
		as a zero padded decimal number. All days in a new year 
		preceding the first Sunday are considered to be in week 0.
	%W	Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) 
		as a decimal number. All days in a new year preceding the 
		first Monday are considered to be in week 0.
	%c	Locale’s appropriate date and time representation.
	%x	Locale’s appropriate date representation.
	%X	Locale’s appropriate time representation.
	%%	A literal '%' character.


  Examples:
         tuptime -d '%X %x'  # (Default)
         tuptime -d '%H:%M:%S   %m-%d-%Y'  # British style
         tuptime -d '%H:%M:%S   %d-%b-%Y'  # Spanish style


-e, --end
  Order table or list by end status at power off. Therefore, only works 
  in conjunction with (-t) or (-l) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -te
         tuptime -le
         tuptime -t --end
         tuptime -l --end


-f <FILE>, --filedb=<FILE>
  Define an alternative database file. Default is located in 
  '/var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db'

  Examples:
         tuptime -f /var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db  # (Default)
         tuptime -f /tmp/test1.db
         tuptime --filedb /tmp/test2.db

  
-g, --graceful
  Register last time in the db as a graceful shutdown. This option is the way
  that tuptime have for know if is a good or a bad shutdown, like a hang of the
  system, for example. This is used in the init.d and systemd files at the 
  shutdown process.

  Examples:
         tuptime -g
         tuptime --graceful


-l, --list
  Enumerate as list each startup number, startup date, uptime, shutdown date, 
  end status and offtime. Multiple order options can be combined together.

  Examples:
         tuptimoe -l
         tuptimoe --list


-o, --offtime
  Order table or list by offtime / downtime. Therefore, only works in conjunction with 
  (-t) or (-l) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -to
         tuptime -lo
         tuptime -t --offtime
         tuptime -l --offtime


-r, --reverse
  Reverse the order for table or list output. Therefore, only works in conjunction with 
  any of (-t), (-l), (-e), (-o) and (-u) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -tr
         tuptime -lur
         tuptime -teo --reverse
         tuptime -l --reverse


-s, --seconds
  Change default human readable date style and print times in seconds and
  dates in epoch.

  Examples:
         tuptime -s
         tuptime --seconds


-t, --table
  Enumerate as table each startup number, startup date, uptime, shutdown date, 
  end status and downtime. Multiple order options can be combined together.

  Examples:
         tuptimoe -t
         tuptimoe --table


-u, --uptime
  Order table or list by uptime. Therefore, only works in conjunction with 
  (-t) or (-l) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -tu
         tuptime -lu
         tuptime -t --uptime
         tuptime -l --uptime


-x, --silent
  Any output is printed. Only update values and save them into disk.

  Examples:
         tuptime -x
         tuptime --silent


-v, --verbose
  Print information about the internals of tuptime. It's good for debugging 
  how it gets the variables.

  Examples:
         tuptime -v
         tuptime --verbose


-V, --version:
  Print version number and exit.

  Examples:
         tuptime -V
         tuptime --version


======================
| Schedule execution |
======================

It's importat to have a schedule execution. If the init or systemd scripts
are installed as it needs, the program only update values at startup and 
shutdown, but if the system fails, hangs or whatever, the uptime time will
be lost. Add this line to cron for avoid it.

15 *    * * *   root    if [ -x /usr/bin/tuptime ]; then /usr/bin/tuptime -x > /dev/null; fi


=============================================
| DB format changes from 2.x to 3.x version |
=============================================

If this error appears:

...(a few lines)...
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: endst

Is because the database have the format of the 2.x release. For migrate it, 
please, execute the script "db-tuptime-migrate.sh" which is located at:

https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime/blob/master/scripts/db-tuptime-migrate.sh
 

================
| Some Toughts |
================

Usually the installation is made with a privileged user, for that reason,
the database file is created with restricted permissions and the unprivileged
users can only read it. This situation is covered for print values, but 
not for update database. In this habitual case, a privileged user need to
execute tuptime for update values at startup and shutdown.

For batch process colums printed in table mode, awk can be used, for example:
   # tuptime | awk -F'[[:space:]][[:space:]][[:space:]]*' '{print $1}'
