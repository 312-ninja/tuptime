============
| Abstract |
============

Tuptime report historical and statistical running time of the system, keeping it between restarts.
Indeed, it can:

  - Count system startups
  - Register first boot time (a.k.a. installation time)
  - Count nicely and accidentally shutdowns 
  - Uptime and downtime percentage since first boot time
  - Accumulated system uptime, downtime and total
  - Largest, shortest and average uptime and downtime
  - Current uptime
  - Print formatted table or list with most of the previous values
  - Register used kernels



=================
| Prerequisites |
=================

Operating system:
   - Linux
   - FreeBSD
   - OSX (Darwin)

Software:
   - Python 2.7 or Python 3.X (Latest recomended)
   - Python modules (most included in python core by default):
       sys, os, optparse, sqlite3, datetime, locale, platform, subprocess, logging, time

If a distro is used, all is met with:
    - In Linux:  'python' package >= 2.7
    - In FreeBSD: '/usr/ports/lang/python' and '/usr/ports/databases/py-sqlite3'
    - In OSX: 'python' installed by default in base system



================
| Installation |
================

For Linux systems:

   + Package install .deb

      Available in Debian Sid (unstable):

         https://packages.debian.org/sid/tuptime

   + Using .sh script:
      
      Download and execute the installation script:

         # bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfrail3/tuptime/master/tuptime-install.sh)

   + Manual install

      Clone repository and copy executable file:

         # cp tuptime/src/tuptime /usr/bin/tuptime
         # chmod 755 /usr/bin/tuptime 

      Add tuptime user:

         # adduser --quiet --system --no-create-home --group \
                --home "/var/lib/tuptime" \
                --shell '/bin/sh' \
                --gecos 'Tuptime execution user,,,' tuptime

      Execute tuptime with a privilege user for create db path:

         # tuptime

      Change owner of the db file:

         # chown -R tuptime:tuptime /var/lib/tuptime

      Copy cron file:

         # cp tuptime/src/cron.d/tuptime /etc/cron.d/tuptime
         # chmod 644 /etc/cron.d/tuptime

      If is a system with systemd, copy service file and enable it:
	
         # cp tuptime/src/systemd/tuptime.service /lib/systemd/system/
         # chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/tuptime.service
         # systemctl enable tuptime.service

      If have upstart system, copy the file:

         # cp tuptime/src/init.d/redhat/tuptime /etc/init.d/tuptime
	 # chmod 755 /etc/init.d/tuptime
	 # chkconfig --add tuptime
	 # chkconfig tuptime on

      If have init system, copy the file:

         # cp tuptime/src/init.d/debian/tuptime /etc/init.d/tuptime
         # chmod 755 /etc/init.d/tuptime
         # update-rc.d tuptime defaults
	 # /etc/init.d/tuptime start


For FreeBSD system:

   + Using FreeBSD ports

     Located at /usr/ports/sysutils/tuptime

   + Manual install

      Clone repository and copy executable file:

         # cp tuptime/src/tuptime /usr/local/bin/tuptime
         # chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/tuptime 

      Add tuptime user:

         # pw adduser tuptime -d /nonexistent -s /bin/sh -c "Tuptime execution user"

      Execute tuptime with a privilege user for create db path:

         # tuptime

      Change owner of the db file:

         # chown -R tuptime:tuptime /var/lib/tuptime

      Add an entry to /etc/crontab

         */5     *       *       *       *       tuptime    /usr/local/bin/tuptime -x

      Copy rc.d file:

         # cp tuptime/src/rc.d/freebsd/tuptime /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tuptime
         # chmod 555 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tuptime
         # echo 'tuptime_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf


For OSX system:

   Tuptime is compatible with OSX but, for now, the project lacks of launchd files
   for the startup and the schedule run.

         tuptime -d '%H:%M:%S   %m-%d-%Y'  # British style
         tuptime -d '%H:%M:%S   %d-%b-%Y'  # Spanish style


-e, --end
  Order table or list by end status at power off. Therefore, only works 
  in conjunction with (-t) or (-l) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -te
         tuptime -le
         tuptime -t --end
         tuptime -l --end


-f <FILE>, --filedb=<FILE>
  Define an alternative database file. Default is located in 
  '/var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db'

  Examples:
         tuptime -f /var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db  # (Default)
         tuptime -f /tmp/test1.db
         tuptime --filedb /tmp/test2.db

  
-g, --graceful
  Register last time in the db as a graceful shutdown. This option is the way
  that tuptime have for know if is a good or a bad shutdown, like a hang of the
  system, for example. This is used in the init.d and systemd files at the 
  shutdown process.

  Examples:
         tuptime -g
         tuptime --graceful


-k, --kernel
  Add kernel information to the output.

         tuptime --kernel
         tuptime -t --kernel


-l, --list
  Enumerate as list each startup number, startup date, uptime, shutdown date, 
  end status and offtime. Multiple order options can be combined together.

  Examples:
         tuptimoe -l
         tuptimoe --list


-o, --offtime
  Order table or list by offtime / downtime. Therefore, only works in conjunction with 
  (-t) or (-l) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -to
         tuptime -lo
         tuptime -t --offtime
         tuptime -l --offtime


-r, --reverse
  Reverse the order for table or list output. Therefore, only works in conjunction with 
  any of (-t), (-l), (-e), (-o), (-u) and (-c) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -tr
         tuptime -lur
         tuptime -teo --reverse
         tuptime -l --reverse


-s, --seconds
  Change default human readable date style and print times in seconds and
  dates in epoch.

  Examples:
         tuptime -s
         tuptime --seconds


-t, --table
  Enumerate as table each startup number, startup date, uptime, shutdown date, 
  end status and downtime. Multiple order options can be combined together.

  Examples:
         tuptimoe -t
         tuptimoe --table


-u, --uptime
  Order table or list by uptime. Therefore, only works in conjunction with 
  (-t) or (-l) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -tu
         tuptime -lu
         tuptime -t --uptime
         tuptime -l --uptime


-v, --verbose
  Print information about the internals of tuptime. It's good for debugging 
  how it gets the variables.

  Examples:
         tuptime -v
         tuptime --verbose


-V, --version:
  Print version number and exit.

  Examples:
         tuptime -V
         tuptime --version


-x, --silent
  Any output is printed. Only update values and save them into disk.

  Examples:
         tuptime -x
         tuptime --silent



======================
| Schedule execution |
======================

It's importat to have a schedule execution. If the init or systemd scripts
are installed as it needs, the program only update values at startup and 
shutdown, but if the system fails, hangs or whatever, the uptime time will
be lost. Be sure that the cron entry is installed as expected.



=============================================
| DB format changes from 2.x to 3.x version |
=============================================

If this error appears:

...(a few lines)...
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: endst

or:

...(a few lines)...
    db_rows[-1][4] = opt.endst
IndexError: list assignment index out of range

Is because the database have the format of the 2.x release. For migrate it, 
please, execute the script "db-tuptime-migrate.sh" which is located at:

https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime/blob/master/scripts/db-tuptime-migrate.sh
 
 

==================
| Database Specs |
==================

Tuptime use a sqlite3 database located in "/var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db" with
the following format:

tuptime (btime integer, 
         uptime real, 
         offbtime integer, 
         endst integer, 
         downtime real, 
         kernel text)

btime    Startup date in epoch
uptime   Uptime seconds  
offbtime Shutdown date in epoch
endst    Type of shutdown [1 ok | 0 bad]
downtime Downtime seconds
kernel   Name of the kernel

The number of startup sequency is extracted from "rowid", the signed integer 
key that uniquely identifies the row within its table in sqlite.

For reset all the values, simply detele the database file.

Is it possible to query and modify it directly. But if a complete row is
deleted and the db is not recreate completely (vacuum), rowid keep the real
information about startup number. Tuptime will advert about it if the verbose
mode is enabled.



================
| Some Toughts |
================

Tuptime can be executed with 'root' user, but it's recomendable the use of an
unprivileged user, like 'tuptime' as the installation section reflects for
avoid security problems. In any case, if the database file is not writable by
the user that execute tuptime, the changes are not saved. This situation is
covered for print values, but not for update database, for that reason, a 
user who can write in the db file must to execuete tuptime for update values
at startup and shutdown at least.

Kernel name is registered each time that tuptime update values. If ksplice is
used to update the kernel, last kernel will have the whole time asignement
since the last system start.

Table output can be processed with awk, for example:

   # tuptime -t | awk -F'[[:space:]][[:space:]][[:space:]]*' '{print $1}'
