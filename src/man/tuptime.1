.SH DESCRIPTION
Tuptime is a tool for report the historical and statistical running time of 
the system, keeping it between restarts. Indeed, it can:
  - Count system startups
  - Register first boot time (a.k.a. installation time)
  - Count nicely and accidentally shutdowns
  - Uptime and downtime percentage since first boot time
  - Accumulated system uptime, downtime and total
  - Largest, shortest and average uptime and downtime
  - Current uptime
  - Print formatted table or list with most of the previous values
  - Report system drifting time
  - Register used kernels
  - Narrow reports since and/or until a given startup or timestamp
  - Reports in csv

.SH DEFAULT OUTPUT
System startups:
  Total number of system startups from since to until date.

System shutdowns:
  Total number of shutdowns done correctly or incorrectly. The separator
  points to the state of last shutdown when it is available (<-) ok, (->) bad.

System uptime:
  Percentage of uptime and time counter.

System downtime:
  Percentage of downtime and time counter.

System life:
  Time counter since first startup date until last.

Largest uptime:
Shortest uptime:
Largest downtime:
Shortest downtime:
  Time counter and date with the largest/shortest uptime register.

Average uptime:
Average downtime:
  Time counter with the average time.

Current uptime:
  Actual time counter and date. Always is update.
